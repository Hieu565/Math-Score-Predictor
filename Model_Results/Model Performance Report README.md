## 📊 Overview

This report compares six predictive models — **Random Forest (CPU & GPU), Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Simple Neural Network, and Optuna-Tuned Neural Network** — using two main evaluation metrics:
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Measures predictive accuracy.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Measures the magnitude of prediction errors.
Both **average, standard deviation**, and **extreme (min/max) results** were analyzed to evaluate not only performance but also **model stability**.

## 🧩 Interpretation
- **Best Accuracy**: **Random Forest (GPU)** has the **highest average R²** and **lowest RMSE**, making it technically the **top performer in predictive power**.
- **Most Stable**: **Random Forest (CPU)** shows the **lowest variation** across runs (both in R² and RMSE), meaning it is the **most reliable and repeatable**.
- **Best Neural Model**: **Optuna Neural Network** is more stable than the Simple NN but does **not outperform Random Forests**.
- **Worst Model**: **Simple Neural Network** — **highly unstable, negative R², and high RMSE**.

## 🧾 Conclusion
While **Random Forest (CPU)** does not yield the **highest R²**, it achieves **low variance and consistent RMSE**, marking it as the **most stable and reliable model** overall.
In contrast, neural networks — particularly the **Simple Neural Network** — show **high volatility and poor generalization**, likely due to inadequate tuning or small dataset size.
Therefore, **Random Forest (CPU)** is recommended for deployment where **consistency and reliability** are prioritized over peak accuracy.
