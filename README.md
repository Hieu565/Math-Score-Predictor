# Math-Score-Predictor
This project is an AI-powered learning assistant designed to help students analyze information, summarize content, and generate study support in real time. Built using Streamlit for the frontend interface, the app connects to a secure backend service that performs advanced model inference.

## ✨ Key Features
- ✅ Interactive AI Chat for question answering
- ✅ Automatic content summarization (text and media)
- ✅ Mind map style learning support
- ✅ Fast and intuitive user interface
- ✅ Accessible from any device via browser

## 🧩 Architecture

This repository contains only the frontend Streamlit application.
User  →  Streamlit App (UI)  →  Secure Backend API  →  AI Model

🔒 The trained models and backend logic are stored in a private repository for security and intellectual property protection.
