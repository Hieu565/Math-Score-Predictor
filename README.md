# Math-Score-Predictor
This project is an AI-powered learning assistant designed to help students analyze information, summarize content, and generate study support in real time. Built using Streamlit for the frontend interface, the app connects to a secure backend service that performs advanced model inference.

## 🔍 Purpose
This project is part of my university application portfolio, demonstrating skills in:
- Machine Learning
- Software Engineering
- Human-computer interaction
- Cloud Application Deployment

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Collect student data through a survey (hours studied, homework completion, focus level, past scores).
- Clean and process the dataset for machine learning.
- Build a predictive model (using regression) to estimate scores.
- Generate study improvement suggestions based on the model.

## ✨ Key Features
- ✅ Interactive AI Chat for question answering
- ✅ Automatic content summarization (text and media)
- ✅ Mind map style learning support
- ✅ Fast and intuitive user interface
- ✅ Accessible from any device via browser

## 🧩 Architecture

This repository contains only the frontend Streamlit application.
User  →  Streamlit App (UI)  →  Secure Backend API  →  AI Model

🔒 The trained models and backend logic are stored in a private repository for security and intellectual property protection.

## 📌 Limitations
- Data is self-reported, which may introduce bias.
- Small dataset may not generalize to all students.
- More features (sleep, tutoring, resources used) could improve accuracy.

## 📚 Future Improvements
- User authentication
- Learning analytics dashboard
- More adaptive response generation
- Voice input/output features
